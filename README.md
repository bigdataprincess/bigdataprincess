ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m a Program Manager within Data and Analytics. I have over 10 years experience in tech, started off my career in Tech and. I am passionate about <strong>telling stories using tech and data.</strong> Currently have a [book series Teach Toddlers Tech](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=iria+osara&i=stripbooks&crid=3TB9966C1K72M&sprefix=iria+osara%2Cstripbooks%2C492&ref=nb_sb_ss_c_2_10_ts-doa-p) while also volunteering as a Data Engineer to non-profit organizations. 

When not in TechLand, I love gardening and blogging about intersection of Tech and our daily lives...I guess one can never leave TechLand :-)
